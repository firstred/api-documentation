Create payment refund
=====================

.. api-name:: Refunds API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments/*id*/refunds

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

Most payment methods support refunds. This means you can request your payment to be refunded to your customer.
The refunded amount will be withheld from your next settlement.

Refunds are not available at all for Bitcoin, paysafecard and gift cards.

Refunds support descriptions, which we will show in the Dashboard, your exports and pass to your customer if possible.

If you have insufficient balance with Mollie to perform the refund, the refund will be ``queued``. We will automatically
process the refund once your balance increases.

Any payments created for Orders can also be refunded using the Payment Refunds API. However, we recommend using the
:doc:`Order Refund API </reference/v2/orders-api/create-order-refund>` in those cases so you can pass the order lines
you are refunding too. For pay after delivery methods, this will improve your customer's experience.

Possible errors
---------------
Sometimes a situation can occur in which it is not possible to perform the refund. In such cases an HTTP ``4xx`` error
will be returned. Some of these situations are illustrated here:

* There might not be enough balance on your account with the payment provider (e.g. PayPal).
* You may have forgotten to grant the appropriate rights to Mollie for the payment provider (PayPal only).
* It is possible that the payment has already been (partially) refunded.
* It is not always possible to do a partial refund.

If you perform many refunds in parallel, you may get an HTTP ``503 Service unavailable`` error. In this case, you can be
certain the refund was not performed and you can safely retry the refund.

If there is a connection issue during the creation of a refund (e.g. a client-side time out is triggered) you should
**not retry automatically** as you cannot be sure the refund has been performed or not. In this case we suggest logging
into the Mollie Dashboard, or retrieving the payment's refunds via the API to validate if the refund has been created.
