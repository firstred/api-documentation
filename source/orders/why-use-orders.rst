Why use Orders?
===============
* The Orders API allows you to use Mollie for your order management, including the payment process.

* *Pay after delivery* payment methods such as *Klarna Pay later* or *Klarna Slice it* require the Orders API and cannot
  be used with the Payments API.

* Some payment methods communicate the order lines to the customer in the hosted payment pages or in an invoice.

* After creating the order using the API the order can also be managed using the
  `Mollie Dashboard <https://www.mollie.com/dashboard>`_. There you can mark individual order lines as shipped, issue
  refunds or canceled.
